# Virtual Assistant using Python
This virtual assistant will recognize your speech and answer using a voice module. It is able to process your voice commands using [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/), and answers through text-to-speech using [Pyttsx3](https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/).

 There are some pre-programed interactions to play with:
- Search videos on YouTube
- Search terms on Wikipedia
- Ask for the current time
- Play your favorite music

## Procedure
1 - Install **\`requirements.txt\`** to get all dependencies.
2 - Run **\`virtual_assistant.py\`**
3 - Ask for a youtube video, a search for some term, what time is it or to play some music
